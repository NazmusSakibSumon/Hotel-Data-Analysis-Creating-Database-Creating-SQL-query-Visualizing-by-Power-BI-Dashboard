Hi, in this project, we will analyze a hotel dataset. We will source data from a database that we will develop by joining and by making unions among tables from a uploaded excel file in MS SQL Server. Then we will connect the database with Power BI to make a dashboard. Our purpose is to answer three pressing questions: 
    1.	Is our hotel revenue growing by year? 
    2.  Should we increase our parking lot size? 
    3.  What trends can we see in the data?
